# C - More singly linked lists

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at `ALX Africa SE`. In this project, I continued in practicing, building and using singly `linked lists` in `C` while learning when and why to use `linked lists` versus `arrays`.

## Technologies
- `C` files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
- `C` files are written according to the `C90 standard`.
- ested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`.


## tests 📁
- [tests](./tests): This directory contains all my `main.c` and exe files for this project.

## lists.h
- [lists.h](./lists.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.


## Files 📃
* All of the following files are programs written in `C`:


_Filename_ | _Description_
-----------|--------------

Tasks 📃
0. Print list

* [0-print_listint.c](./0-print_listint.c): C function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` linked list.
    - Returns the number of nodes in the `listint_t` list.
