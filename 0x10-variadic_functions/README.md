# Variadic functions

* Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at **ALX Africa SE.** It aims to learn about variadic functions in **C language.**

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the `C90 standard.`
* Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS.`

## Private 📁
* [private](./private): This directory contains all my main.c and exe files for this project.

## variadic_functions.h
- [variadic_functions.h](./variadic_functions.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

## Files 📃
> All of the following files are programs written in C:

**Filename** | **Description**
-------------|----------------
[0-sum_them_all.c](./0-sum_them_all.c) | `A function that returns the sum of all its parameters.`
[1-print_numbers.c](./1-print_numbers.c) | `A function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.`
[2-print_strings.c](./2-print_strings.c) | `A function that prints strings, followed by a new line.`
[3-print_all.c](./3-print_all.c) | `A function that prints anything.`
[README.md](./README.md) | `A README.md File`

## Tasks 📃

- 0. **Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant**
    * [0-sum_them_all.c](./0-sum_them_all.c): C function that returns the sum of all its paramters.
        - If the parameter `n == 0`, the function returns 0.

- 1. **To be is to be the value of a variable**
